# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console :house_with_garden:

### üìù Descripci√≥n
***
__Airbnb__ is an online platform that connects people who have a home to offer, with people who need a place to stay temporarily.

This is the first phase of an eight phase project, where we create The AirBnB Clone and create a shell to manage the AirBnB objects.

This Phase of the project focuses on everything about Python:
`Import`,` Exceptions`, `Class`, `Private attribute`, `Getter / Setter`, `Class method`, `Static method`, `Inheritance`, `Unittest`, `Read / Write file`, `args `and` kwargs`, `Serialization` / `Deserialization` and `JSON`.

Phases of the AirBnB clone project:
**1. The console**
2. HTML
3. MySQL
4. Fabric
5. Flask
6. REST API
7. Web dynamic

### üìã Requirements
***
#### Python Scripts

* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
* Files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
* Files must be executable.
* The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.

#### Python Unit Tests

* All your test files should be inside a folder `tests`.
* You have to use the unittest module.
* All your test files should be python files (extension: `.py`).
* All your test files and folders should start by `test_`.
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m unittest discover tests`.

### üé® Style
***
* Code should use the PEP 8 style (version 2.7.*).

### üß™ Testing
***
Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:
```bash
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
```
But also in non-interactive mode:
```bash
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
```
All tests should also pass in non-interactive mode:
`$ echo "python3 -m unittest discover tests" | bash`
